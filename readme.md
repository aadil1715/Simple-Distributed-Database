Title : Simple Distributed Database.

This project deals with design and implementation of a simple distributed database. This proposal explains the 
programming language and data structures that will be used to develop the program. Along with this, the 
algorithm and test cases will provide an overall view of the system behavior. Meeting logs describe the 
discussion that took place in order to achieve this goal while the Gantt chart provides the execution plan of this 
project.
